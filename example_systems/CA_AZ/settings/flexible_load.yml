# Electrification scenarios are supplied in two files. EFS_STOCK_AGG.parquet has scenarios
# from the NREL Electrification Futures Study (EFS). SCENARIO_STOCK.parquet has scenarios
# from the Princeton Net Zero study. The scenario name will depend on which source you
# use. The NREL EFS scenarios include:

# HIGH ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# MEDIUM ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# REFERENCE ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT

# The Princeton Net Zero scenarios include:

# current_policy
# stated_policy
# deep_decarbonization
# moderate_decarbonization

# The type of flexible loads that can be included as demand response resources are:

# Res_WH_MW (residential water heating)
# Com_WH_MW (commercial water heating)
# Res_SPH_MW (residential space heating)
# Com_SPH_MW (commercial space heating)
# LDV_MW (light duty vehicles)
# MDV_MW (medium duty vehicles)
# HDV_MW (heavy duty vehicles)
